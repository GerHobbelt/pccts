This is a quick hack that I developed to better understand how to make
flex and antlr play together.  Since the darn thing took me the better
part of one entire morning, I thought others might also benefit from my
toils.  Hence, this message.  Be forwarned, this is only a hack that I've
developed strictly for myself and, consequently, the makefile has some
hardcoded paths that you'll have to change.  I do not pretend to be a
programming expert nor a pccts expert, thus you should take all this with
a grain of salt (or pepper or....).
