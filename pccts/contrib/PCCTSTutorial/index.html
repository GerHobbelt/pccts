      <H1>THIS IS THE PCCTS 1.33 TUTORIAL!</H1>
      <H3><A href="http://javadude.com/articles/antlrtut/index.html">Look Here 
      for the ANTLR 2.x Tutorial!</A></H3>
      <H1>Source Code</H1>
      <H2>Tutorial Examples and HTML</H2>
      <P>Before starting the tutorial, I just wanted to point out that all the 
      source code for the examples contained within is available via the 
      following links.&nbsp; In addition, the entire HTML source for this 
      tutorial (minus this paragraph as I'm too lazy to re-zip it right now) is 
      also available as a zip.</P>
      <H2>My Original Compiler Project</H2>
      <P>Someone sent me a note asking for my original compiler project.&nbsp; I 
      figured "what the heck" and dug it up and sent it to him.&nbsp; Then I 
      figured "what the heck" again and decided to post it here.&nbsp; If you 
      download this and try it and it still works, please let me know!</P>
      <P>A few notes on this project's contents:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The project consisted of 
        <UL>
          <LI>A compiler, <TT>xl</TT>, which compiles <TT>*.xl</TT> files into 
          <TT>*.o</TT> files 
          <LI>An interpreter, <TT>go</TT>, which executes the <TT>*.o</TT> files 

          <LI>A disassembler, <TT>dis</TT>, which disassembles <TT>*.o</TT> 
          files (extra credit!) </LI></UL>
        <LI>I have not touched it since the class, and I'm not terribly sure 
        exactly what's there... 
        <LI>I <EM>think</EM> I had ok comments in the code -- hopefully it's 
        readable... 
        <LI>Some of the code is rather wide -- sorry about this, but I set it up 
        to print nicely landscape 
        <LI>It doesn't exactly match the recognizer built for this tutorial (I 
        started from scratch when doing the tutorial. 
        <LI>Much of the source code in this zip is the actual PCCTS 1.20 support 
        code (including a simple symbol table.)&nbsp; I think there shoud be 
        everything present here to actually compile and run this, but I haven't 
        tried it in years so I can't guarantee it. 
        <LI>Keep in mind that I've learned a lot since I took the course, so 
        some things in the course compiler may be weird. 
        <LI>I used PCCTS 1.20 for the course, and some features like semantic 
        predicates were not quite working right.&nbsp; Therefore I had to do a 
        few things differently than I would had predicates worked 
        properly.&nbsp; (Now 1.33 is available and works well.) 
        <LI>I wrote the compiler project on an Amiga 2000.&nbsp; (Yup, that's 
        right, I'm an Amiga fanatic.&nbsp; Unfortunately I had to turn to the 
        dark side and use a PC for application/speed reasons.&nbsp; A 25MHz 
        Amiga may have performed as well as a 66MHz PC, but now I've got a 
        233MHz PII...) 
        <UL>
          <LI>I used the SAS/C/C++ compiler.&nbsp; The file SCOPTIONS is just a 
          compiler option file 
          <LI>The makefile <EM>should</EM> be pretty close to what you'd need on 
          Unix (the Amiga really acted like a unix machine wrt how you run 
          commands and compiling stuff.&nbsp; Using PCCTS was just a matter of 
          changing the compiler name in the PCCTS makefile.&nbsp; 
          Really!&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <EM>that</EM> easy) </LI></UL>
        <LI>The test directory contains: 
        <UL>
          <LI><TT>*.xl</TT> files: the sample source files (I think they should 
          be the same as the ones provided in this tut but I haven't checked.) 
          <LI><TT>ast</TT> dir: outputs displaying the ASTs generated from the 
          sources 
          <LI><TT>dis</TT> dir: disassembly outputs 
          <LI><TT>err</TT> dir: compiler messages for each source file 
          <LI><TT>o</TT> dir: compiler-generated object files </LI></UL></LI></UL>
