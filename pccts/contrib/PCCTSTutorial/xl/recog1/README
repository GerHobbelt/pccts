recog1.zip, recog1.tgz
======================
This is the initial grammar file as created while working through
the recognizer section of the tutorial.

You are free to do whatever you wish with this software.
However, I do not take responsibility for any damage done
to your software or hardware by using it.  Not that I think
this stuff will harm you, but I guess I gotta say this anyway.

Files included in this distribution:
    xl.mdp   -- Visual C++ 4.2 project file
    xl.mak   -- Visual C++ 4.2 makefile
    xl.g     -- the PCCTS grammar file
    makefile -- a UNIX makefile for building the recognizer
    readme   -- this file

Note that the VC++ project file assumes there is a
   c:\pccts\h
directory that contains the contents of the h directory
of the PCCTS distribution.

If you want to use the UNIX makefile, you will need to
edit it to tell it the name of your compiler and where you
keep your PCCTS base directory.
