                        Example of "#parser foo":

                        Old: #define zztokenLA      xyz_zztokenLA
                             #define AST            xyz_AST

                        New: #define zztokenLA      foo_zztokenLA
                             #define AST            foo_AST
                        
157     table entry $j  Kees van der Bent <kees@translogic.nl>

                        The table entry for $j incorrectly states that
                        actions are counted in determining the value of
                        $j.

Appendix        It appears the Appendix is based on PCCTS 1.32, an out-of-date
                version of the "Notes for New Users".  For instance the
                ANTLRToken hierarchy is from before the introduction of
                reference counted tokens and the file name extensions are
                assumed to be .C rather than .cpp.

                skip(), and more() are not complicated".
