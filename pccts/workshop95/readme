The proceedings of the workshop '95 are given in this directory.
Unfortunately, about 25% of the submissions gave our postscript
printer fits.  I doubt you will be able to view some of the
files included here.  Sorry.  So much for portable postscript
generation ;)

[November 2, 1995 Glenn Lewis suggested fixes to the postscript.
 The changes have been made.  NOTE: the .zip file has *already* been
 converted from LF to CRLF for DOS users.  John Mitchell made the
 changes.]

[November 3, 1995.  I think they all work now.]
