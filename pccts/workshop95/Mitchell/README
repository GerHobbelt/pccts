This directory contains a wacko little thing I whipped up.

If you just run 'make' you'll get a normal, command line parser that is
basically a slightly improved version of my contribution to Tom Moog's
Notes for PCCTS Users distribution.

If, on the other hand, you type 'make parserd' you will get a Tcl/Tk shell
application which has the aforementioned parser as one of it's built in
commands.  This parser command may be run in the local with or, as an added
bonus, remotely via an RPC call.

No big whup, I just wanted to show how a PCCTS parser could be integrated
into a Tcl/Tk application.

Note that the only really painful part of this entire process is getting
all of the Tcl/Tk extensions built and then linked in together with the
parser.  All of the Tcl/Tk related cruft is at the bottom of the makefile.

Feel free to email if things don't make sense. :-)

Take care,
	John
